🧬 Skin Cancer Mutation RAG System

📋 Executive Synopsis & Alignment

The Assignment Goal: The objective was to engineer a creative AI solution utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, HuggingFace biomolecular datasets, and external biological knowledge bases (like UniProt).

The Solution: Our team successfully delivered on these objectives by narrowing the scope to a high-impact domain: Clinical Oncology. We engineered a specialized RAG system that allows clinicians and researchers to query complex information regarding skin cancer mutations (e.g., BRAF, NRAS, TP53).

Objective-to-Solution Matrix:
Assignment Objective	Implemented Solution
Use LLMs	Integrated Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (Quantized) for high-performance, local inference.
Build RAG Pipeline	Implemented a Semantic Search engine using FAISS and Sentence-Transformers.
HuggingFace Data	Ingested, filtered, and indexed the "Mol-Instructions" dataset specifically for melanoma/carcinoma contexts.
Knowledge Bases	Built a real-time UniProt API Bridge to fetch ground-truth protein metadata, reducing hallucination.
Production AI Track	Utilized 4-bit quantization (bitsandbytes) and memory-efficient caching to ensure the tool runs on consumer hardware/Free-tier Colab.

📘 Project Overview

This project acts as an intelligent assistant for molecular oncology. Unlike a general-purpose chatbot, this system is grounded in scientific literature and biological facts. It answers questions specifically related to skin cancer protein mutations by combining three distinct layers of intelligence:

    1. Knowledge Retrieval (RAG): Fetches relevant scientific instructions from a curated subset of the "Mol-Instructions" dataset.
    2. Fact-Checking (API): Real-time integration with the UniProt Knowledgebase to validate protein function, structure, and accession IDs.
    3. Generative Synthesis (LLM): Uses a quantized Llama-3 model to synthesize the retrieved context into coherent clinical answers.

📂 System Architecture & API Reference

The application is structured into five modular classes, ensuring separation of concerns between data ingestion, retrieval, and generation.

1. Data Ingestion: MolInstructionsFilter
    • Role: The Gatekeeper.
    • Function: Manages the ingestion of raw scientific text. It prevents the model from being diluted by general chemistry data by strictly filtering for skin-cancer-related terms (e.g., 'melanoma', 'V600E').
    • Key Method: download_and_filter(max_samples=5000) — Streams the massive "zjunlp/Mol-Instructions" dataset and saves a local optimized JSON (cancer_filtered.json).

2. Knowledge Base Bridge: UniProtCache
    • Role: The Fact-Checker.
    • Function: Connects to the UniProt Knowledgebase to provide "ground truth" data. This is critical for preventing LLM hallucinations regarding gene names or biological functions.
    • Key Method: fetch_protein_info(gene_name) — Queries the UniProt REST API to extract Protein Name, Function, and Sequence Length.
    • Optimization: Includes a _load_cache mechanism to prevent redundant API calls for commonly queried proteins (BRAF, TP53).

3. The Search Engine: CancerRAGRetriever
    • Role: The Librarian.
    • Function: Converts text into mathematical vectors and retrieves specific scientific contexts relevant to the user's query.
    • Key Method: build_index(data) — Creates a FAISS Index (IndexFlatIP) for efficient cosine similarity search.
    • Key Method: retrieve(query, top_k=3) — Returns the top 3 most relevant scientific snippets for the prompt.

4. The Brain: QuantizedLLM
    • Role: The Synthesizer.
    • Function: A memory-efficient wrapper for the Llama model. By using NF4 (NormalFloat 4-bit) quantization, we achieve high performance with significantly lower VRAM usage.
    • Key Method: generate(prompt) — Runs the inference loop with temperature control (0.7) to balance creativity and factual adherence.

5. Main Controller: CancerMutationRAG
    • Role: The Conductor.
    • Function: Orchestrates the entire pipeline.
    • Workflow (query method):
        1. Retrieve: Calls CancerRAGRetriever to get text docs.
        2. Verify: Scans query for gene names and calls UniProtCache.
        3. Construct: Merges docs + UniProt facts into a strict system prompt.
        4. Generate: Calls QuantizedLLM for the final answer.


🚀 Usage Example

code Python

# Initialize the system
rag_system = CancerMutationRAG()
rag_system.initialize()

# Query the system
response = rag_system.query("How does the BRAF V600E mutation affect melanoma treatment?")
print(response)
  

📝 Final Project Summary

Project: Skin Cancer Mutation RAG System
Domain: Molecular Science / Oncology
Status: Completed

This project demonstrates a sophisticated application of Applied AI in the biomedical field. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with structured biological APIs (UniProt), the team successfully mitigated the common issue of LLM hallucination. The solution is not merely a theoretical prototype but a production-optimized tool (utilizing quantization) capable of running on accessible hardware. It meets all criteria of the group assignment, delivering a specialized, high-utility software solution for molecular science.
