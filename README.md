The Solution: By narrowing the scope to a high-impact local domain eg the widespread use and abuse of skin bleaching creams within the African context and the attendent high incidence of pathology relating to skin diseases, for  Clinical Oncology We were able to engineer a specialized RAG system that allows clinicians and researchers to query complex information regarding skin cancer mutations (e.g., BRAF, NRAS, TP53).

Objective-to-Solution Matrix:
Assignment Objective	Implemented Solution
Use LLMs	Integrated Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (Quantized) for high-performance, local inference.
Build RAG Pipeline	Implemented a Semantic Search engine using FAISS and Sentence-Transformers.
HuggingFace Data	Ingested, filtered, and indexed the "Mol-Instructions" dataset specifically for melanoma/carcinoma contexts.
Knowledge Bases	Built a real-time UniProt API Bridge to fetch ground-truth protein metadata, reducing hallucination.
Production AI Track	Utilized 4-bit quantization (bitsandbytes) and memory-efficient caching to ensure the tool runs on consumer hardware/Free-tier Colab.


📘OVERVIEW|DATA ORIGIN|PREPROCESSING

The overall aim of the Project is to develop a useful tool for molecular dermatological oncology that would also be of high imapct within the african health space.
Distinctly different from an off the shelf general-purpose chatbot, our solution is primed on concurrent scientific literature and biological facts. 

The tool is specifically focused on skin cancer protein mutations by combining three distinct layers of applied Data:

    1. Knowledge Retrieval (RAG): Fetches relevant scientific instructions from a curated subset of the "Mol-Instructions" dataset.
    2. Fact-Checking (API): Real-time integration with the UniProt Knowledgebase to validate protein function, structure, and accession IDs.
    3. Generative Synthesis (LLM): Uses a quantized Llama-3 model to synthesize the retrieved context into coherent clinical answers.

📂SYSTEM ACHITECTURE AND API REFERENCE

1. Data Ingestion: MolInstructions
    • Role: The Gatekeeper.
    • Function: Manages the ingestion of raw scientific text. It restricts the data ingestion/ input strictly within skin-cancer-related terms (e.g., 'melanoma', 'V600E').
    • Key Method: download_and_filter(max_samples=5000) — Streams the massive "zjunlp/Mol-Instructions" dataset and saves a local optimized JSON (cancer_filtered.json).

2. Knowledge Base Bridge: UniProt
    • Role: The Fact-Checker.
    • Function: Connects to the UniProt Knowledgebase to provide "ground truth" data. This is critical for preventing LLM hallucinations regarding gene names or biological functions.
    • Key Method: fetch_protein_info(gene_name) — Queries the UniProt REST API to extract Protein Name, Function, and Sequence Length.
    • Optimization: Includes a _load_cache mechanism to prevent redundant API calls for commonly queried proteins (BRAF, TP53).

3. The Search Engine: CancerRAGRetriever
    • Role: The Librarian.
    • Function: Converts text into mathematical vectors and retrieves specific scientific contexts relevant to the user's query.
    • Key Method: build_index(data) — Creates a FAISS Index (IndexFlatIP) for efficient cosine similarity search.
    • Key Method: retrieve(query, top_k=3) — Returns the top 3 most relevant scientific snippets for the prompt.

4. The Brain: QuantizedLLM
    • Role: The Synthesizer.
    • Function: A memory-efficient wrapper for the Llama model. By using NF4 (NormalFloat 4-bit) quantization, we achieve high performance with significantly lower VRAM usage.
    • Key Method: generate(prompt) — Runs the inference loop with temperature control (0.7) to balance creativity and factual adherence.

5. Main Controller: CancerMutationRAG
    • Role: The Conductor.
    • Function: Orchestrates the entire pipeline.
    • Workflow (query method):
        1. Retrieve: Calls CancerRAGRetriever to get text docs.
        2. Verify: Scans query for gene names and calls UniProtCache.
        3. Construct: Merges docs + UniProt facts into a strict system prompt.
        4. Generate: Calls QuantizedLLM for the final answer.


🚀 Usage Example

code Python

# Initialize the system
rag_system = CancerMutationRAG()
rag_system.initialize()

# Query the system
response = rag_system.query("How does the BRAF V600E mutation affect melanoma treatment?")
print(response)
  

📝 Final Project Summary

Project: Skin Cancer Mutation RAG System
Domain: Molecular Science / Oncology
Status: Completed

This project demonstrates a sophisticated application of Applied AI in the biomedical field. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with structured biological APIs (UniProt), the team successfully mitigated the common issue of LLM hallucination. The solution is not merely a theoretical prototype but a production-optimized tool (utilizing quantization) capable of running on accessible hardware. It meets all criteria of the group assignment, delivering a specialized, high-utility software solution for molecular science.
